I created this software as part of the final project of completing my degree in computer science. 
The software is easy to use: the user inserts a video that is not leveled or rotates sideways or backwards 
The software shows you the first frame and asks which angle you want 
to rotate all the frames in the video => The user selects and moves on => The computer breaks up the video into 
frames and turns each frame and frame and then connects them The software is written in Matlab
